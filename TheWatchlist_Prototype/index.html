              Extraction I
              <p>Rating it 10/10 solely because Chris Hemsworth is in it. But also the fight scenes are real good. Lots of funky punches and kicks.</p>

              Scream IV
              <p>Too many scream movies. Too predictable. But the cast was attractive so...</p>
              <p>Just kidding. Just didn't think it was scary enough. Didn't make me <i>scream</i>.</p>

              Twilight
              <p>Can't even lie to you when I say that this saga was one of the most toe curling, sanity draining films i've ever seen in my entire life. I can't believe I ever thought these films were the best ever. Don't know wtf younger me was on.</p>
              <p>Anyways, team Jacob 4 eva and 4 lyfe.</p>

              The Killer
              <p>Love the movie poster. The actual film? Not so much. It was a just a bit boring and for a film that's titled "the killer", I just expected a LOT more action.</p>

            Special Ops: Lioness
            <p>Did my girlies so dirty, but we all knew it was gonna end in heartbreak because if not, the show would not have been dramatic enough.</p>

          The Walking Dead
          <p>Seen the first few episode and yikers...it's ahm interesting to say the least. Need a lot more suspense and zombies actually killing people. But kudos to them tryin to survive, because if I was in a zombie apocalypse, let's just say that if the zombies don't get me, my boredom will.</p>

          Brooklyn Nine-Nine
          <p>The funniest show to ever exist in my opinion. You feeling sad and just in a loser mood? Watch this and while it won't stop you from being a loser, it'll make you laugh. I guarantee it. NINE NINE!!</p>

          The Originals
          <p>So much better than the actual show it's based off of. Not as cringe, but definitely still questionable. But who doesn't love a group batshit crazy and psychotic bloodsuckers :D</p>

          Lucifer
          <p>Christians would not have a good time watching this show. Good thing I'm not christian!! It's funny, and dare I say- devilish. My guy solves crimes in this show and with crime, there's action so it was good enough for me.</p>

          The Last of Us
          <p>Aside from the absolute banging music, this show had a perfect cast and it was a fun and awesome watch. Needed a whole lot more of them infected though. Pedro and Bella <3 The ending was heartbreaking as always ;)</p>
